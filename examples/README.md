# Examples #

* For examples using the PyTorch backend (`pgbm`), see the [pytorch](https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/pytorch/) folder.
* For examples using the Numba backend (`pgbm_nb`), see the [numba](https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/numba/) folder. The Numba backend does not support autodifferentiation and it supports less distributions.
* For examples using the PyTorch-distributed backend (`pgbm_dist`), see the [pytorch_dist](https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/blob/main/examples/pytorch_dist/) folder.
