# Support #
In general, PGBM works similar to existing gradient boosting packages such as LightGBM or xgboost (and it should be possible to more or less use it as a drop-in replacement).

In case you experience any issues, please make sure to:
1. Read the [docs](./index.rst)
2. Check the [function reference](./function_reference.rst)
3. Check the [examples](./examples.md)

In case further support is required, [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm/issues).
